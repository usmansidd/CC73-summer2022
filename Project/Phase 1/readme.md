Language Selected:
We have selected Mini-C language that has a syntax similar to C.
Or in other words you can say it’s a subset of C language.
Language Specification:
Mini-C is straightforward language like C-language intended to satisfy for educational purposes. It very well may be utilized by students of any institute/college to find and learn about programming compilation that is easy to execute.
It consists of:
“if-statement”
Example of If-then-else Statement:
“Paste if then-else example here”
 
 
 
“loop”
(while loop)
“Paste example of loop here”
 
Also, it consists of:
“variables”
“arithematic operations(%,*,+,-)”
“comparisions(>,<,=<=,>=,==,!=)”
“logical operations(&&,||,!)”
“concatenations b/w Strings”
 


It doesn’t include:
“Structures”
“Arrays”
“Files”
“Unions”
“Switch Statements”
“Do Statements”
 
 
Also, It doesn’t consists of “main” function like other programming languages that are: “C”,”Java”,”Python” and “Javascript”. Also Mini-C doesn’t support user-defined functions too.
 

If we talk about Data types, following are mentioned below:
“Int”,”string”,”bool”,”double” and “float”.
 
To summarize above data-types. Let’s have a look how it can be executed in example below:
To Print a string:
string abc //declare
void print(abc)
void printIn(abc)
 
To Read Number:
Int readInt()
double readDouble()
 

To read string of all characters:
string readLine()
