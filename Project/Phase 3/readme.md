# Phase 3

## Phase Name
C code to Python Code Converter

## Heading


## What is happening
Explanation

## Features
The phase can convert the code in mini C language to that of python. It does the following by using regular expressions in Flex and using grammars in Yacc. 

## Organization of Files
File Name | Details
------------ | -------------
Code Folder | Contains the input i.e the code to convert the language of
Output | Contains the output of the program i.e python code
lex.l | Flex code
lex.yy.c| Flex compilation file
yacc.y | Yacc code



## Takeaways
-> Got a better understanding of how the compilers work  
-> Deeper understanding of how errors are caught in a compiler  
-> Understanding of grammars and parsing
