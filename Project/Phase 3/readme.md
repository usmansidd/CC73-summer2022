# Phase 3

## Phase Name
C code to Python Code Converter

## Heading


## What is happening
Explanation

## Features
The phase can convert the code in mini C language to that of python. It does the following by using regular expressions in Flex and using grammars in Yacc. 

## Organization of Files
File Name | Details
------------ | -------------
code.c | The code to make tokens of
lex.l | Flex code for the Lexical Analyzer
lex.yy.c| Flex code for the Lexical Analyzer
yacc.y | Flex code for the Lexical Analyzer



## Takeaways
-> Got a better understanding of how the compilers work
-> deeper understanding of how errors are caught in a compiler
-> Understanding of grammars and parsing
