PROJECT REPORT
(FLEX PROGRAM)
7-July-2022

1.	**Project Background and Description:**
Flex GCC is used : 
Code is executed on CMD (C code)
“A flex program that will accept a valid ISO standard email address and international phone number.”

2. Problems and Issues:
First of all, required libraries must be installed before executing the code. Our block of code was not running without “yywrap()” for “validemail” code. 
It was asking for a wrap reference. So wrap up library is installed to execute our code without any hurdles.

There were no problems found in our “validphonenumber” program and it was executed properly. However, we added some conditions to improve our code.
